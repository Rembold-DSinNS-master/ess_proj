# Earth and Climate Science Project
This repository is to serve as a central communication and storage area for everything you may need in this project on earth and climate science. Feel free to upload papers, data (if it isn't too huge), analysis scripts, and later your actual presentation and paper to this location. **As promised, if both you and your partner have a commit history that includes at least one commit (each) per week, I'll throw some extra credit your way on the project as a reward for really grappling with and learning Git and GitHub in a collaborative setting.**

Also included in this repository are markdown files recapping the basic project guidelines.

Presentations and a rough draft of the paper will be on July 26, and then the final draft of the paper will be due the following Friday (July 29).
